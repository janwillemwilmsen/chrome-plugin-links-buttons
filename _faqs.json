    "question": "What does this extension do?",
    "answer": "This extension analyzes images on webpages for accessibility issues. It helps identify images that are missing alt text, have empty alt attributes, or may need accessibility improvements."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why doesn't Scroll To work?",
    "answer": "The element is probably hidden. If a webpage uses responsive technology that uses different html for mobile and desktop, this can cause elements to be hidden in some cases. Also when elements are in fly-out menus or interactive applications that change the page layout, some elements may be hidden."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I use the filter buttons?",
    "answer": "The filter buttons at the top of the images list allow you to show or hide different types of images. Click on a button to toggle filtering for that category. An open eye icon means you're viewing that type of image, while a closed eye means those images are hidden."
  },

  {
    "question": "What are know issues/limitations with this extension?",
    "answer": "This extension is not without flaws, and there are some known issues. <br><ul><li>Gif images are not supported.</li><li>Images in iframes are not supported.</li><li>Images in 'Sprites' are not supported. All images in the sprite images are in the preview view. (A sprite is a single image with multiple images inside it. It reduces the number of HTTP requests to the server, which is good for performance.)</li><li>Webpages that are highly dynamic, use lazyloading, use placeholder images, or inject images into the DOM after the initial page load, may not be supported.<b>Scroll to the bottom of the page, making sure all images have loaded, and open the extension.</b></li><li>Font icons are not supported.</li><li>Scrolling only works on visible images.</li><li>Aria hidden is only tested 10 levels up the DOM tree.</li><li>Links that are injected via javascript after the page has loaded are probably missed in the analysis.</li></ul>"
